            3. HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION
            </h2>
            <p>
            We generally collect personal information directly from the individual. For
            example, personal information will be collected when an individual applies for
            credit, visits our website, or sends us correspondence. Sometimes we may need
            to collect personal information about an individual from a third party, such
            as financial institutions, other credit providers or a CRB. When we are
            provided with personal information from a third party, we will take reasonable
            steps to ensure that the individual is made aware of the matters set out in
            this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
            EAF will not collect sensitive information unless the individual has consented
            or an exemption under the APPs applies. These exceptions include if the
            collection is required or authorised by law or necessary to take appropriate
            action in relation to suspected unlawful activity or serious misconduct.
            </p>
            <p>
            If the personal information we request is not provided, we may not be able to
            process an individual’s application for credit, or meet an individual’s needs
            appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
            EAF does not give individuals the option of dealing with it anonymously, or
            under a pseudonym. This is because it is impractical, and in some
            circumstances illegal, for EAF to deal with individuals who are not
            identified.

            <h2 id="4-unsolicited-personal-information">
            4. UNSOLICITED PERSONAL INFORMATION
            </h2>
            <p>
            EAF may receive unsolicited personal information about individuals. EAF’s
            employees are required to notify the Privacy Officer of all unsolicited
            personal information received by them. We destroy or de-identify all
            unsolicited personal information, unless the personal information is relevant
            to EAF’s purposes for collecting personal information.

            related to the primary purpose and in other circumstances authorised by the

            <p>
            We use and disclose personal information for the purposes outlined in section

            apply (e.g., where required by law). Credit information will only be used and

            <p>
            We engage other people to perform services for us, which may involve that

            the specific purpose for which we supply it. We prohibit that person from
            using the individual’s information for the purposes of direct marketing their

            </h2>
            <p>
            The APPs require us to take all reasonable steps to protect the security of
            personal information, including credit information. EAF employees must respect
            the confidentiality of the personal information we collect. EAF takes
            reasonable steps to protect personal information held from misuse, loss,
            interference, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. All personal
            information contained in hard copy documents held by EAF is stored in locked
            offices. All personal information stored on EAF’s computer system is backed up
            regularly, and back-up copies are held in a secure location. In relation to
            our customer database, we apply the following guidelines:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>data ownership is clearly defined within EAF;</li>
            <li>passwords are routinely checked;</li>
            <li>
                we change employees’ access capabilities when they are assigned to a new
                position;
            </li>
            <li>employees have restricted access to certain sections of the system;</li>
            <li>
                unauthorised employees are barred from updating and editing personal
                information;
            </li>
            <li>
                all personal computers which contain personal information are secured,
                physically and electronically;
            </li>
            <li>data is encrypted during transmission over the network;</li>
            <li>print reporting of data containing personal information is limited;</li>
            <li>
                EAF has created procedures for the disposal of personal information; and

            </ul>
            <p>
            Where we no longer require personal information we will take reasonable steps
            to destroy or de-identify it.

            <h2 id="13-direct-marketing">13. DIRECT MARKETING</h2>
            <p>

            <ul>
            <li>the personal information does not include sensitive information; and</li>
            <li>
                the individual would reasonably expect us to use or disclose the information
                for the purpose of direct marketing; and
            </li>
            <li>we provide a simple way of opting out of direct marketing; and</li>
            <li>
                the individual has not requested to opt out of receiving direct marketing
                from us.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            If the individual would not reasonably expect us to use or disclose the
            information for the purpose of direct marketing, we may only use or disclose
            that information for direct marketing if the individual has consented to the
            use or disclosure of the information for direct marketing or it is
            impracticable to obtain that consent.
            </p>
            <p>
            In relation to sensitive information, EAF may only use or disclose sensitive
            information about an individual for the purpose of direct marketing if the
            individual has consented to the use or disclosure of the information for that
            purpose. We will not use or disclose credit information for the purposes of
            direct marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
            Individuals can opt out of direct marketing by contacting us, and we must give
            effect to the request within a reasonable period of time. Individuals may also
            request that EAF provides them with the source of their information. If such a
            request is made, EAF must notify the individual of the source of the
            information free of charge within a reasonable period of time.

            <p>
            We will not use identifiers assigned by the Government, such as a tax file
            number, Medicare number or provider number, for our own file recording
            purposes, unless one of the exemptions in the Privacy Act applies. EAF

            EAF takes reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information, including
            credit information and credit eligibility information, it collects, uses and
            discloses is relevant, accurate, complete and up-to-date.
            </p>
            <p>
            We encourage individuals to contact us in order to update any personal
            information we hold about them. If we correct information that has previously
            been disclosed to another entity, we will notify the other entity within a
            reasonable period of the correction. Where we are satisfied information is
            inaccurate, we will take reasonable steps to correct the information within 30
            days, unless the individual agrees otherwise. We do not charge individuals for
            correcting the information.

            Subject to the exceptions set out in the Privacy Act, individuals may gain
            access to the personal information, including credit information, which EAF
            holds about them by contacting the EAF Privacy Officer. We will provide access
            within 30 days of the individual’s request. If we refuse to provide access, we
            will provide reasons for the refusal.
            </p>

            It is the responsibility of management to inform employees and other relevant

            ensure that they periodically advise EAF’s employees and other relevant Third
            Parties of any changes to the Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is the responsibility of all employees and other relevant parties to ensure
            that they understand and comply with this Privacy Policy. Ignorance of the
            existence of the Privacy Policy will not be an acceptable excuse for
            non-compliance.

            privacy training, which covers EAF’s obligations under the Act, the APPs and
            the Code. Employees must ensure that they understand the Privacy related

            <p>
            EAF has an effective complaints handling process in place to manage privacy
            risks and issues, which involves:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>identifying (and addressing) any systemic compliance problems; and</li>
            <li>handling individual complaints about privacy quickly and effectively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Individuals can make a complaint to EAF about the handling of their personal
            information, including credit information, by lodging a complaint with the
            Privacy Officer. It is anticipated that in most cases the complaint will be
            able to be settled to the client’s satisfaction by simply making us aware of
            the issue for quick resolution. Disputes are to be resolved as soon as
            possible, but within 14 days of receiving any dispute (by writing, email,
            website or a verbal dispute) , Equal Access will write to the affected party
            advising the result of our investigation or advise if more time is required to
            complete the investigation. This correspondence will also acknowledge the
            external dispute resolution process should the internal dispute resolution
            process be unsuccessful or the affected party is still not satisfied with the
            outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
            All disputes will be acknowledged in writing to the client and noted in the
            Dispute Register.
            </p>
            <p>
            If the individual is unsatisfied with our response to their complaint, the

            an independent review by visiting AFCA’s website at
